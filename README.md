# INFOTC1000-Final-Project
Info. Tech. 1000 Final Project done in Markdown

>Project Details: For this project, I will be transcribing my notes for a [**Dungeons and Dragons**](https://dnd.wizards.com) campaign that I run with my friends. I have plans to make these notes into a personal web page at some point with HTML and JavaScript. This will allow me to query the notes, as well as perform functions during gameplay that will make my note taking, and running the game, smoother/easier.
