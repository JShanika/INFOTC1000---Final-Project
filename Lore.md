## Creation Myth

### The Two Sisters

>Out of timeless nothing, there rose dark and indistinct mists, foreshadowing of what was to come, an idea of existence, guided by the all watching Lord Ao, The Hidden One.

>With time, the mists began to change. Out of the idea, form came to be. INto a primeval expanse, secluded from the rest of the multiverse, twin spirits were born: The sisters who were one, one of them being cool brightness, and one of soothing darkness. They existed in perfect static harmony for eons.

>Then there was a pull, and a push. The sister' harmony began to flow. There was a rise, and fall. There was up, and down, Ground, and above. In between this flow, a new form was created.

>The sisers nnoticed the change. The bright one, Selune, was curious about the things that they had created, while the dark one, Shar, was bothered by the sudden flow of existence. But still, form was hollow, with no idea of itself. Selune touched a form with her brightness, while Shar withdrew from it. Conscience was sparked in the form and spread throughout it's entire being.

>Thus the world was born, but it was still incomplete and only ideas pressed into form. It cried out, and Selune nurtured it with light, while Shar watched it warily from a distance in the shadows. The world begged for warmth so that she could nurture life and living creatures upon the planets that were her body and limbs, and the two sisters became divided, as for the first time they were of two minds. Silvery Selune contested with her dark sister over whether or not to bring further life to the worlds. A battle ensued, and from the spirits argument, new concepts were born that spread into the world, and formed into being. These beings later formed into the ideas of life, death, light, trickery, war, knowledge, nature, and tempest. They took part in the deific struggle constantly changing sides.

>During the battle, Selune seized the advantage and reached across time and space to the inner core of creation, a roiling chaos of unformed elemental chaos. She grabbed part of it, burning and eroding her divine essence in the process, and placed it in the world as a Sun, giving warmth and comfort to the world, so that life could awaken and thrive. Shar took advantage of her sisters injury, and began an assault. Selune in desperation took a part of her own divine spark, and threw it at her sister. As it tore through her, a new diety was born, Mystryl, the goddess of magic.

>Though Mystryl was composedd of both light and dark magic, she favored her first mother Selune, allowing the silver goddess to win an uneasy truce with her now more powerful, dark twin. Consumed by bitterness and rage, she vowed revenge though Mystryl and Selune keep her in check to this day.

>Shar remains in the shadows of the world, while Selune waxed and waned in power, often drawing strength from the dieties and mortals greatful for this worlds creation from the infinite Astral Sea.

### The Lords of Chaos

>While the sisters fought their first eon-spanning battles, The world was unprotected, and on waves of elemental chaos, powerful beings of manifested entropy rode into the world and began to shape it to their own desires. These beings are known by sages simply as The Primordials.

>The Goddesses came to a halt in their struggle when the world was plunged into darkness as a primordial, Dendar the Night Serpent, snatched the sun from the sky. The twin sisters recognized the primordial threat and bargained an alliance. Shar wished for the primordials to be gone so the world may return to void and mist, while Selune wished to protect the world and all of life from destruction and slavery.

### The Dawn War

>A cataclysmic war raged over the world. The Elder Gods, led by Selune and Shar, called forth into existence a pantheon of dieties from the very ideas they created togethor. Both sides suffered casualties until a primordial named Dendar, The Night Serpent, betrayed his fellow primordials and aided in the killing or imprisonment of them all. For this he was granted a space in the world that was to be untouched by divine being, never to leave. This was the creation of Bantear, the continent lost in time.

>The primordials weren't the only side to have betrayers. During this time, a few dieties, now known as The Betrayers, were caught aiding the primordials out oftheir own chaotic hearts. These dieties included, Tharizdun, and Torog. After the war, Tharizdun was sent out into the Elemental Chaos, imprisoned by the gods and never to return, and Torog was left to suffer, cursed, in the core of the world, forever crawling and boring large tunnels trying to escape to no success. This was how the Underdark was created. Tharizdun is said to still hold some power in the matierial plane however, granting boons to the few accult that follow his being.

#### The Vestiges of Divergence
>Some of these dieties looked upon the few patches of life that suffered under the primordials paths, and gifted them items infused with part of their own divine spark. These weapons and armaments were called The Vestiges of Divergence. With this power, mortals were able to survive, and fight back against these primeval inaders. These Vestiges were either passed down through generations, or lost along the way, waiting to be rediscovered.

## Known History
### The Days of Courage
>During this time period, post Dawn War, life on Tallahs, named by the mortals who inhabited it, thrived and expanded across the land. The gods walked among the mortals, some aiding in their progress, others hiding, plotting their own intrests. After 1500 years of evolution, the gods decided that some parts of this world were either too bright, or too dark. The gods argued over this fact, the inhabitants of both sides began to clash once more.

### The Sunddering
>Lord Ao, who had stayed hidden until now, stepped into the world once more and sunddered existance into structured order. This was the creation of the outer planes, and the splitting of the material plane. The Feywild was created out of everything too bright for this world, and the Shadowfell out of everything too dark.

>Catastrophy struck civilization as he did this, sending the material plane back into the stone age, reseting life on Tallahs with the old world left to rubble and ruin.

>The only races to survive this sunddering were the Fey, Sarrukh, Batrachi, Aearee, and a quick evolving species of primates, soon to be the Humans of Tallahs.


## Planes of Existance
>The Planes of existance include, The Astral Sea, The Elemental Chaos, The Outer Planes, and the Inner.

>Many dieties found the outer planes to be habitable, fitting to their extreme alignments, while the Inner was left to the mortals. Portals between the planes existed throughout the material plane, however finding one was extremely rare, and surviving the other side was never a gaurauntee.





## Dieties
>The pantheon of the divine was split into 8 parts, aligning with the original 8 ideas Shar and Selune brought into existance. Under these 8 domains existed countless dieties with varying amounts of divine power. This divine power now being understood as the returned favor of mortals who worship these beings.
