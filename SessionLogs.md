[Table of Contents][TC]|[Previous page][I]

## Session 01
>The party is hired by Glim Remesk to escort him to Serenis. While in Caldwell, they discover a strange planar device that Glim believes is very powerful revolutionary magic that could be dangerous. They defeat the gargoyle created by it, and set off for Serenis.

## Session 02
>The party on there way to the Emerde Wetlands meet Kutt, a tortle hunter that tasks them with killing an abandoned mine full of gnolls that have been killing the wildlife. They succeded and discovered inside, Iapar's crate of holy symbols he had been smuggling. In the mine Griffith dove into a pool of water that had been used as a waste pool full of rotting meat and excrament. He discovered a Bag of Holding, with 400 gp of gems inside.

## Session 03
>Once the party arrives in Queens Breech, they split up. Griffith and Danger kill Jeremiah Grayfield for his ring of protection, and weapons in his blacksmith shop. Arpenis attracts the attention of Iapars guard. Griffith and Danger go to the gypsey house where they are put under a sleep spell, while Spike and Arpenis sleep in the inn with Glim. They narrowly escape and defeat the hags that were disquising as gypseys, and while exploring their subterranean lair, find a secret passage to a basment. Not knowing where this was, and hearing multiple guards coming, they light the room on fire and run. Once they emerge from the gypsey house they see that the Draconic Embassy is ablaze. Realizing what they had done, they flee town.

## Session 04
>Once in Serenis, Griffith aquires work with the thieves guild clearing some monsters being flushed out of the sewers by the rising sea levels. Arpenis meets a sailor that he is fond of named Teth. Spike meets with the Cobalt Soul monastary and is allowed to view their library.

## Session 05
>The party hears someone they have been searching for is locked up in the prisons, and begin planning a  prison break to get to talk to him. They escape but not without two guards recognizing them. The prisoner has seen the amulet Arpenis searches for from his dreams. He said it was wreathed in smoke and shadow and gave him a bad vibe. The party is found and escorted to the high council where they are told they are under arrest and will serve their sentence doing a dangerous mission for the city under the watch of Rader Nivrev and his crew. The rising sea levels have been tearing apart the coastline and have been getting progressivly worse. Rader believes the source of the problem is an ancient artifact in The Vestigial Sea, The Heart of The Tides.

## Session 06
>The party gains two new members, Thok, and Uther. They accompany the party on their trip when Uther finds ship passage with his fathers old crew, Order of The Radiant Heart. Glim warns the party about Rader, and says whatever artifact this is it has a strong connection to the plane of water.

## Session 07
>The party, along with Rader, clear a Sahuagin temple, and find the next clue to the artifact. Danger has a dream from Mystra and Azuth, the gods of magic. They saved a young sea helf boy from the sahuagin, and Rader shows them the spiral like path they must follow on the sea to find the final temple. Rader promises to stop by the sea elfs village along the way.

## Session 08
>The party stocks up on supplies at the sea elf village and returns the boy. Rader offers the party a choice to continue with him, or investigate Vesrah while his crew gathers the other clues. Before splitting with Rader, Uther sneaks into Raders room and steals his belongings, including the chest that he uses to hold The Mace of The Black Crown.

## Session 09
>After getting caught on the reef defenses of the city, they arrive at Vesrah, home of the Water Ashari, an Atlanntis like city floating atop the water. The Raven Queen contacts Griffith and Spike as possible champions. The party goes to a casino/inn/magic shop ran by a Genie Marid.

## Session 10
>The party kills and aquires the eye of an aboleth underneath the city near the portal to the plane of water. Danger is killed by a water elemental. The party meets Gallen Stormclaw, a goliath druid who is very knowledgeable about the plane of water and wishe to see the Heart of The Tides returned to the city for safe keeping.

## Session 11
>The aboleth is slain, Griffith and Spike meet with The Raven Queen in the Shadowfell and are given The Deathwalker's Ward. The area around the portal to the shadowfell is littered with ghost like fish and spirits.They meet Vhaemas, the leader of The Water Ashari.

## Session 12
>Rader finds the party and kidnaps them all furious they disobeyed him. They all go to the final temple where they defeat Sekolah. Rader, Zhalhu, and The Caedogeist all try and escape with the Heart, but the party acts quick and kills them all, before escaping to the underdark through a underwater cave system.

## Session 13
>The party finds themselves in a Duergar Stronghold, and makes a deal to help them with a problem in their mines as long as they will guide the party back to the surface. They agree, and the party discovers the mines have dug into a Myconid colony, and most of the Dwarves gone missing have ate so many hallucinogenic mushrooms they have gone brain dead, or overdosed. The party meets with the leaders of the colony and make a deal to take a large spore to the stronghold and place it inside. The party instead keeps the spore, and decieves the Dwarf king that they killed the problems. The Duergar court wizard teleports the party back to the surface, raders ship, using one of raders tools as an anchor point.

## Session 14
>The party returns to serenis and wrap up many strings, finally out from under Raders control, and saving the city from imminent destruction. Spike is told to go see the friends of The Knowing Mistress. Uther hears that the Orc tribes from the south have begun moving northward again, just like so many years ago when they killed his father in the war. The leading tribe is Thok's old tribe, The Bloody Spear Cast.
