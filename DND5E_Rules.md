# D&D 5E Rules
>These are the standard rulesets for D&D 5E. All other pages in the repository correspond to my own custom, _"homebrew"_, rules and stats.
>The three pillars of an adventure include, exploration, social interaction, and combat.

>**Exploration-** Includes both the adventurers’ movement
through the world and their interaction with objects and
situations that require their attention. Exploration is the
give and take of the players describing what they want
their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling
the players what happens as a result. On a large scale,
that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a 
rolling plain or an hour making their way through
caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could
mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to
see what happens.

>**Social Interaction-** Features the adventurers talking to
someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding
that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the
goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner,
pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading
a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to
the adventurers.

>**Combat-** Involves characters
and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells,
maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort
to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing
every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat
is the most structured element of a D&D session, with
creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets
a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle,
there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to
attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs
on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by
pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other
creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.



## D&D Stats and Ability Scores
>In D&D, there are six main attributes to a character in play. They are, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intellignece, and Charisma, 
>or STR,DEX,CON,WIS,INT,CHA, respectivly. These will be used when the Dungeon Master, DM, asks for an ability check, and can be used by themselves or looked 
at through the characters "Skills" section of their character sheet where a player may have proficincies applied from racial, class, or background benefits.

>You find these stats through a number of ways including using the 5E standard array of stats, 15,14,13,12,10,8 , or by rolling them with 4d6 and dropping the lowest dice six times.
>These numbers define which areas your character has high ability and low ability in. You can apply these umbers in whichever order you wish, however it is good to keep in mind 
that there are benefits to your numbers depending on the racial benefits you recieve after choosing a race.
