# DND 5E Rules
[Table of Contents][TC]|[Previous page][TC]|[Next page][L]

>These are the standard rulesets for D&D 5E. All other pages in the repository correspond to my own custom, _"homebrew"_, rules and stats.
>The three pillars of an adventure include, exploration, social interaction, and combat.

>**Exploration-** Includes both the adventurers’ movement
through the world and their interaction with objects and
situations that require their attention. Exploration is the
give and take of the players describing what they want
their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling
the players what happens as a result. On a large scale,
that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a 
rolling plain or an hour making their way through
caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could
mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to
see what happens.

>**Social Interaction-** Features the adventurers talking to
someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding
that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the
goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner,
pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading
a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to
the adventurers.

>**Combat-** Involves characters
and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells,
maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort
to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing
every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat
is the most structured element of a D&D session, with
creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets
a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle,
there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to
attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs
on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by
pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other
creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.

## D&D Stats and Ability Scores
>In D&D, there are six main attributes to a character in play. They are, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intellignece, and Charisma, 
>or STR,DEX,CON,WIS,INT,CHA, respectivly. These will be used when the Dungeon Master, DM, asks for an ability check, and can be used by themselves or looked 
at through the characters "Skills" section of their character sheet where a player may have proficincies applied from racial, class, or background benefits.

>You find these stats through a number of ways including using the 5E standard array of stats, 15,14,13,12,10,8 , or by rolling them with 4d6 and dropping the lowest dice six times. Ex. 4d6(_5 + 4 + 1 + 2_), makes an ability score of 11(_5 + 4 + 2_), before racial increases.
>These numbers define which areas your character has high ability and low ability in. You can apply these numbers in whichever order you wish, however it is good to keep in mind 
that there are benefits to your numbers depending on the racial benefits you recieve after choosing a race.

|Stat|Description|Related Skills|
|:-|:-:|:-:|
|Strength|This ability score determines your characters raw physical aptitude for things like climbing, jumping, lifting, pushing, and grappling. Most weapons in D&D also use STR for its modifiers, unless it is a finesse weapon|Athletics, Intimidation _(strength based)_|
|Dexterity|This ability score determines how dextrous your character is and is used as a quantifier for how nimble, agile, and flexible your character is, as well as being the modifier for finesse, and ranged weapons|Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth|
|Constitution|This ability score determines how hearty your character is. A high constitution means a larger HP pool, as well as abilities like resisting poisons, increased endurance, and even holding your breath|Holding Breath, Resisting Poison, Endurance, and Concentration|
|Wisdom|This ability score determines how well versed a character is with the natural world. This differs from intelligence in that you aren't applying book smarts but instead your ability to apply experience and cunning|Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival|
|Intelligence|This ability score is used for a characters book smarts. The ability to recall information, and understand complex systems, like a wizards study of magic, or a dwarves known history of stonework and masonry.|Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion|
|Charisma|This ability score determines how well your character can interact with other player characters, PCs, or non-player characters, NPCs. This can be described in many ways including attractivness, social grace, or even manipulative abilities|Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion|

>In D&D there are some races and backgrounds that benefit certain classes much more than others, for example an Orc would be a much better barbarian than a gnome would. This allows for many players to try an min-max their characters to be the best they can. This is a fun strategy for making a character however I would also argue that a varied combination of things youre interested in can make for a much more enjoying and rich role-playing experience, as well as forcing a unique kind of play for a specific class making the game less _"railroaded"_ in design. That being said, here is a structured layout for what classes require ability wise, and which races can benefit your stats for play.

|Stat|Important For|Racial Increases|
|:-|:-:|:-:|
|Strength|Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin|Mountain Dwarf (+2), Half-Orc (+2), Dragonborn (+2), Human (+1)|
|Dexterity|Monk, Ranger, Rogue|Elf (+2), Forest Gnome (+1), Halfling (+2), Human (+1)|
|Constitution|Everyone|Dwarf (+2), Half-Orc (+1), Stout Halfling (+1), Rock Gnome (+1), Human (+1)|
|Wisdom|Cleric, Druid|Hill Dwarf (+1), Wood Elf (+1), Human (+1)|
|Intelligence|Wizard, Artificer|High Elf (+1), Gnome (+2), Tiefling (+1), Human (+1)|
|Charisma|Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock|Half-Elf (+2), Drow (+1), Lightfoot Halfling (+1), Dragonborn (+1), Tiefling (+2), Human (+1)|

>Ability scores are used to determine ability modifiers. Modifiers are what is used on a dice roll for a specific action, either adding to the number rolled, meaning you are good in that ability, or subtracting, meaning you are bad. They are found by subtracting 10 from the score, and dividing by two, round down. An ability score can never exceed 20 unless stated otherwise by things like magical items, or feats.

### Ability Scores and Modifiers
|Score|Modifier|Score|Modifier|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|-5|16-17|+3|
|2-3|-4|18-19|+4|
|4-5|-3|20-21|+5|
|6-7|-2|22-23|+6|
|8-9|-1|24-25|+7|
|10-11|+0|26-27|+8|
|12-13|+1|28-29|+9|
|14-15|+2|30|+10|
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Dice Rules
>There are six types of die used in the game, identified with the short hand of "d", followed by the number of sides on the die. They are the d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4. A number prefacing this shorthand, Ex. 4d6, means that the roll requires four different d6.

### The D20
>The d20 is the most used dice in the game. It is used for all ability checks and are modified by the six ability scores your character uses. The process for rolling follows,
1. **Roll the die and add a modifier.** 
>Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it
sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill.
2. **Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.**
>A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check like, Advantage/Disadvantage, or many different spells including Bane/Bless.
3. **Compare the total to a target number.**
>If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s
a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.
The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).
This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play

### Advantage and Disadvantage
>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and
disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or
disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.
For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. Having both advantage and disadvantage on a roll cancels them both out, making the roll a normal single d20 roll.

>Advantage and Disadvantage can only be applied once, even if multiple circumstances grant you either. For example, having two circumstances granting advantage still only allows one extra dice to be rolled. However if you have for example two advantages, and one disadvantage, instead of them canceling out, there is an extra advantage not cancelled by the disadvantage, granting the roll advantage still.

### Specific Beats General
>With so many rules and differing abilities in players and monsters, there are exceptions to many rules within the game. In these cases the specific rule always overrides the general. This is mostly seen in spellcasting, and racial abiities.

### Round Down
>As seen already with the ability scores, in D&D any number that has been split and is now a non integer will be rounded down, always.

## Races
>A visit to one of the greatest cities in the worlds of Dungeons and Dragons — Waterdeep, the Free City of Greyhawk, or even uncanny Sigil, the City of Doors—
overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens o f different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants. And the people them selves—people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues—represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities. Scattered among the members of these more common races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Halfelves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging to the races of either of their parents. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drow —a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind.

### Dwarf
>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs —these common threads unite all dwarves.
### Elf
>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.
### Halfling
>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
### Human
>In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have  something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.
### Dragonborn
>Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
### Gnome
>A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their closeknit communities.  Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.
### Half-Elf
>Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.
### Half-Orc
>Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes som etim es form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.
### Tiefling
>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable.
### Goliath
>At the highest mountain peaks — far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl — dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship with them. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.
### Goblin
>Goblins occupy an uneasy place in a dangerous world, and they react by lashing out at any creatures they believe they can bully. Cunning in battle and cruel in victory, goblins are fawning and servile in defeat.
### Kobold
>Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and weak, but these little reptilian creatures actually have a strong social structure that stresses devotion to the tribe, are clever with their hands, and viciously work together in order to overcome their physical limitations.
### Orc
>Savage and fearless, orc tribes are ever in search of elves, dwarves, and humans to destroy. Motivated by their hatred of the civilized races of the world and their need to satisfy the demands of their deities, the orcs know that if they fight well and bring glory to their tribe, Gruumsh will call them home.
### Firbolg
>Firbolgs are fey-oriented half-giants. Their tribes cloister in remote forest strongholds, preferring to spend their days in quiet harmony with the woods. When provoked, firbolgs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and druidic magic.
### Tabaxi
>Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tabaxi are catlike humanoids driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts, gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders. Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long. Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost.
### Genasi
>The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time. The powerful genies, however, don’t face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit—whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito. Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.
### Aasimar
>Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens. They are descended from humans with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.
### Warforged
>The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. The first warforged were mindless automatons, but House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced fully sentient soldiers, blending organic and inorganic materials. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond the war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killing machine, or a visionary in search of purpose and meaning.
### Tortle
>What many tortles consider a simple life, others might call a life of adventure. Tortles are born near sandy coastlines, but as soon as they're able to walk on two legs, they become nomad survivalists eager to explore the wilderness, experience its many wonders, put their skills to the test, and make new acquaintances.
### Lizardfolk
>Lizardfolk possess an alien and inscrutable mindset, their desires and thoughts driven by a different set of basic principles than those of warm-blooded creatures. Their dismal swamp homes might lie hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins is far greater.
### Changeling
>A changeling can shift its face and form with a thought. Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression, but it’s an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat known changelings with fear and suspicion.
### Yuan-Ti
>The serpent creatures known as yuan-ti are all that remains of an ancient, decadent human empire. Ages ago their dark gods taught them profane, cannibalistic rituals to mix their flesh with that of snakes, producing a caste-based society of hybrids in which the most snakelike are the leaders and the most humanlike are spies and agents in foreign lands.

### Race Traits
>Races with subraces will gain all of the features of the generic, as well as adding their specific subraces abilities.
>*The variant human is another option for the human race. This variant replaces the ability score increases and allows a choice of proficincy in one skill, and adding one feat.*

## Classes
>Class is the primary definition of what your character
can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s
calling. Class shapes the way you think about the
world and interact with it and your relationship with
other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter,
for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms
of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a
pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might
see him self as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan
or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the
fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army,
the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and
devotees who share his faith.

>Your class gives you a variety of special features, such
as a fighter’s mastery of weapons and armor, and a
wizard’s spells. At low levels, your class gives you only
two or three features, but as you advance in level you
gain more and your existing features often improve.
Each class entry in this chapter includes a table
summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and
a detailed explanation of each one.

## Conditions
>During play there are many conditions that can be applied to you, your party, or an enemy. They each provide varying circumstances that could affect your turn, rolls, or abilities. Most Conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

### Blinded
>A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against that creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

### Charmed
>A charmed creature can’t Attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful Abilities or magical Effects. The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

### Deafened
>A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

### Frightened
>A frightened creature has disadvantage on Ability Checks and Attack Rolls while the source of its fear is within Line of Sight. The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

### Grappled
>A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. The condition ends if the Grappler is incapacitated (see the condition). The condition also ends if an Effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the Grappler or Grappling Effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the Thunderwave spell.

### Incapacitated
>An incapacitated creature can’t take Actions or Reactions.

### Invisible
>An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a Special sense. For the Purpose of Hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. Attack Rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s Attack Rolls have advantage.

### Paralyzed
>A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity Saving Throws. Attack Rolls against the creature have advantage. Any Attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

### Petrified
>A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging. The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. Attack Rolls against the creature have advantage. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity Saving Throws. The creature has Resistance to all damage. The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

### Poisoned
>A poisoned creature has disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Ability Checks.

### Prone
>A prone creature’s only Movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. The creature has disadvantage on Attack Rolls. An Attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the Attack roll has disadvantage.

### Restrained
>A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. Attack Rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s Attack Rolls have disadvantage. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity Saving Throws.

### Stunned
>A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity Saving Throws. Attack Rolls against the creature have advantage.

### Unconscious
>An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity Saving Throws. Attack Rolls against the creature have advantage. Any Attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

### Exhaustion
>Some Special Abilities and Environmental Hazards, such as starvation and the long-­term Effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a Special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An Effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.

|Level|Effect|
|:-|:-:|
|1|Disadvantage on all ability checks|
|2|Speed halved|
|3|Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|
|4|Hit point maximum halved|
|5|Speed reduced to 0|
|6|Death|

>If an already exhausted creature suffers another Effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description. A creature suffers the Effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on Ability Checks. An Effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion Effects Ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1. Finishing a Long Rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

## Spells
>A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds. Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead. Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.

>Spells are leveled 0-9, and spellcasters increase the level of spells they can cast by leveling up. Every spellcasting class has its own rules for known and prepaired spells. Most spell casters have spell slots that define how many spells of a certain level can be cast. Lower level spells can be cast with higher level spell slots, and may increase the effects. Cantrips are 0th level spells and can be cast an unlimited amount of times, and they also level up with the player. Ritual spells can be cast without using a spell slot by taking 10 minutes longer to cast it.
