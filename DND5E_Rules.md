# D&D 5E Rules
[Table of Contents][TC]|[Previous page][TC]|[Next page][L]
>These are the standard rulesets for D&D 5E. All other pages in the repository correspond to my own custom, _"homebrew"_, rules and stats.
>The three pillars of an adventure include, exploration, social interaction, and combat.

>**Exploration-** Includes both the adventurers’ movement
through the world and their interaction with objects and
situations that require their attention. Exploration is the
give and take of the players describing what they want
their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling
the players what happens as a result. On a large scale,
that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a 
rolling plain or an hour making their way through
caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could
mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to
see what happens.

>**Social Interaction-** Features the adventurers talking to
someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding
that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the
goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner,
pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading
a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to
the adventurers.

>**Combat-** Involves characters
and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells,
maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort
to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing
every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat
is the most structured element of a D&D session, with
creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets
a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle,
there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to
attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs
on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by
pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other
creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.



## D&D Stats and Ability Scores
>In D&D, there are six main attributes to a character in play. They are, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intellignece, and Charisma, 
>or STR,DEX,CON,WIS,INT,CHA, respectivly. These will be used when the Dungeon Master, DM, asks for an ability check, and can be used by themselves or looked 
at through the characters "Skills" section of their character sheet where a player may have proficincies applied from racial, class, or background benefits.

>You find these stats through a number of ways including using the 5E standard array of stats, 15,14,13,12,10,8 , or by rolling them with 4d6 and dropping the lowest dice six times. Ex. 4d6(_5 + 4 + 1 + 2_), makes an ability score of 11(_5 + 4 + 2_), before racial increases.
>These numbers define which areas your character has high ability and low ability in. You can apply these numbers in whichever order you wish, however it is good to keep in mind 
that there are benefits to your numbers depending on the racial benefits you recieve after choosing a race.

|Stat|Description|Related Skills|
|:-|:-:|:-:|
|Strength|This ability score determines your characters raw physical aptitude for things like climbing, jumping, lifting, pushing, and grappling. Most weapons in D&D also use STR for its modifiers, unless it is a finesse weapon|Athletics, Intimidation _(strength based)_|
|Dexterity|This ability score determines how dextrous your character is and is used as a quantifier for how nimble, agile, and flexible your character is, as well as being the modifier for finesse, and ranged weapons|Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth|
|Constitution|This ability score determines how hearty your character is. A high constitution means a larger HP pool, as well as abilities like resisting poisons, increased endurance, and even holding your breath|Holding Breath, Resisting Poison, Endurance, and Concentration|
|Wisdom|This ability score determines how well versed a character is with the natural world. This differs from intelligence in that you aren't applying book smarts but instead your ability to apply experience and cunning|Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival|
|Intelligence|This ability score is used for a characters book smarts. The ability to recall information, and understand complex systems, like a wizards study of magic, or a dwarves known history of stonework and masonry.|Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion|
|Charisma|This ability score determines how well your character can interact with other player characters, PCs, or non-player characters, NPCs. This can be described in many ways including attractivness, social grace, or even manipulative abilities|Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion|

>In D&D there are some races and backgrounds that benefit certain classes much more than others, for example an Orc would be a much better barbarian than a gnome would. This allows for many players to try an min-max their characters to be the best they can. This is a fun strategy for making a character however I would also argue that a varied combination of things youre interested in can make for a much more enjoying and rich role-playing experience, as well as forcing a unique kind of play for a specific class making the game less _"railroaded"_ in design. That being said, here is a structured layout for what classes require ability wise, and which races can benefit your stats for play.

|Stat|Important For|Racial Increases|
|:-|:-:|:-:|
|Strength|Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin|Mountain Dwarf (+2), Half-Orc (+2), Dragonborn (+2), Human (+1)|
|Dexterity|Monk, Ranger, Rogue|Elf (+2), Forest Gnome (+1), Halfling (+2), Human (+1)|
|Constitution|Everyone|Dwarf (+2), Half-Orc (+1), Stout Halfling (+1), Rock Gnome (+1), Human (+1)|
|Wisdom|Cleric, Druid|Hill Dwarf (+1), Wood Elf (+1), Human (+1)|
|Intelligence|Wizard, Artificer|High Elf (+1), Gnome (+2), Tiefling (+1), Human (+1)|
|Charisma|Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock|Half-Elf (+2), Drow (+1), Lightfoot Halfling (+1), Dragonborn (+1), Tiefling (+2), Human (+1)|

>Ability scores are used to determine ability modifiers. Modifiers are what is used on a dice roll for a specific action, either adding to the number rolled, meaning you are good in that ability, or subtracting, meaning you are bad. They are found by subtracting 10 from the score, and dividing by two, round down. An ability score can never exceed 20 unless stated otherwise by things like magical items, or feats.

### Ability Scores and Modifiers
|Score|Modifier|Score|Modifier|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|-5|16-17|+3|
|2-3|-4|18-19|+4|
|4-5|-3|20-21|+5|
|6-7|-2|22-23|+6|
|8-9|-1|24-25|+7|
|10-11|+0|26-27|+8|
|12-13|+1|28-29|+9|
|14-15|+2|30|+10|

## Dice Rules
>There are six types of die used in the game, identified with the short hand of "d", followed by the number of sides on the die. They are the d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4. A number prefacing this shorthand, Ex. 4d6, means that the roll requires four different d6.

### The D20
>The d20 is the most used dice in the game. It is used for all ability checks and are modified by the six ability scores your character uses. The process for rolling follows,
1. **Roll the die and add a modifier.** 
>Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it
sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill.
2. **Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.**
>A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check like, Advantage/Disadvantage, or many different spells including Bane/Bless.
3. **Compare the total to a target number.**
>If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s
a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.
The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).
This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play

### Advantage and Disadvantage
>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and
disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or
disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.
For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. Having both advantage and disadvantage on a roll cancels them both out, making the roll a normal single d20 roll.

>Advantage and Disadvantage can only be applied once, even if multiple circumstances grant you either. For example, having two circumstances granting advantage still only allows one extra dice to be rolled. However if you have for example two advantages, and one disadvantage, instead of them canceling out, there is an extra advantage not cancelled by the disadvantage, granting the roll advantage still.

### Specific Beats General
>With so many rules and differing abilities in players and monsters, there are exceptions to many rules within the game. In these cases the specific rule always overrides the general. This is mostly seen in spellcasting, and racial abiities.

### Round Down
>As seen already with the ability scores, in D&D any number that has been split and is now a non integer will be rounded down, always.
