# D&D 5E Rules
>These are the standard rulesets for D&D 5E. All other pages in the repository correspond to my own custom, _"homebrew"_, rules and stats.

## D&D Stats and Ability Scores
>In D&D, there are six main attributes to a character in play. They are, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intellignece, and Charisma, 
>or STR,DEX,CON,WIS,INT,CHA, respectivly. These will be used when the Dungeon Master, DM, asks for an ability check, and can be used by themselves or looked 
at through the characters "Skills" section of their character sheet where a player may have proficincies applied from racial, class, or background benefits.

>You find these stats through a number of ways including using the 5E standard array of stats, 15,14,13,12,10,8 , or by rolling them with 4d6 and dropping the lowest dice six times.
>These numbers define which areas your character has high ability and low ability in. You can apply these umbers in whichever order you wish, however it is good to keep in mind 
that there are benefits to your numbers depending on the racial benefits you recieve after choosing a race.
